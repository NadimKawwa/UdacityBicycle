## Project: Explore Bike Share Data

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [csv](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html)
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html)
- [pprint](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Bike_Share_Analysisipynb` notebook file.


## Data

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.
